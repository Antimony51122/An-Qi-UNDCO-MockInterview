**In what ways has the United Nations offer been better tailored to different country settings, such as small island developing States and least developed countries?**

The United Nations offer has been better tailored to different country settings, such as small island developing States and least developed countries, in several ways:

1. For many small island developing States, new multi-country Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks have been established, such as for the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean and the Pacific, enabling a system-wide engagement to address regional vulnerabilities and needs [20]. Additionally, in Cabo Verde, a strong support system focused on small island developing States was developed through the participation of various United Nations entities in the design of cooperation frameworks, addressing trade, e-commerce, innovative financing, and digital strategies [20].

2. Tailored support has also been improved for least developed countries, with entities like ITC, UNEP, and WMO lending their expertise for the first time for programme delivery in countries like Zambia [20]. This tailored support approach is aimed at filling capacity gaps identified through the cooperation framework design process, ultimately enhancing the delivery of support and assistance to these countries.

3. Resident coordinators have played a key role in improving the quality of the United Nations offer by engaging all relevant parts of the United Nations development system, regardless of where these capacities are based [19]. This inclusive approach has led to more effective responses and increased ability to access United Nations expertise in host countries, with a rise in the percentage of host Governments perceiving that resident coordinators had provided increased access to expertise [19].

Overall, through tailored cooperation frameworks, strengthened partnerships, and improved engagement of United Nations entities, the United Nations offer has been better tailored to meet the specific needs and priorities of small island developing States and least developed countries, contributing to more effective and sustainable development outcomes in these country settings.

联合国的援助方案已经针对不同国家环境进行了更好的定制，例如小岛屿发展中国家和最不发达国家，具体体现在以下几个方面：

1. 对于许多小岛屿发展中国家，已经建立了新的多国可持续发展合作框架，例如针对讲英语和荷兰语的加勒比地区和小岛屿发展中国家以及太平洋地区，使整个系统能够全面参与，以解决区域脆弱性和需求[20]。此外，在佛得角，通过多个联合国实体参与合作框架的设计，为小岛屿发展中国家开发了一个强大的支持系统，这些框架涉及贸易、电子商务、创新融资和数字战略[20]。

2. 对最不发达国家的定制支持也得到了改善，像国际贸易中心（ITC）、联合国环境规划署（UNEP）和世界气象组织（WMO）这样的实体首次为像赞比亚这样的国家提供项目交付方面的专业知识[20]。这种定制支持方法旨在填补通过合作框架设计过程中发现的能力差距，最终增强对这些国家的支持和援助的交付。

3. 驻地协调员在提高联合国援助方案的质量方面发挥了关键作用，他们参与了联合国发展系统所有相关部分的工作，无论这些能力位于何处[19]。这种包容性方法导致了更有效的响应，并增加了在东道国获取联合国专业知识的能力，东道国政府感知到驻地协调员提供了更多专业知识的百分比有所增加[19]。

总体而言，通过定制的合作框架、加强伙伴关系以及改善联合国实体的参与，联合国的援助方案已经更好地定制，以满足小岛屿发展中国家和最不发达国家的具体需求和优先事项，为这些国家环境带来了更有效和可持续的发展成果。
