**In what ways has the United Nations offer been better tailored to different country settings, such as small island developing States and least developed countries?**

The United Nations offer has been better tailored to different country settings, such as small island developing States and least developed countries, in several ways:

1. For many small island developing States, new multi-country Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks have been established, such as for the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean and the Pacific, enabling a system-wide engagement to address regional vulnerabilities and needs [20]. Additionally, in Cabo Verde, a strong support system focused on small island developing States was developed through the participation of various United Nations entities in the design of cooperation frameworks, addressing trade, e-commerce, innovative financing, and digital strategies [20].

2. Tailored support has also been improved for least developed countries, with entities like ITC, UNEP, and WMO lending their expertise for the first time for programme delivery in countries like Zambia [20]. This tailored support approach is aimed at filling capacity gaps identified through the cooperation framework design process, ultimately enhancing the delivery of support and assistance to these countries.

3. Resident coordinators have played a key role in improving the quality of the United Nations offer by engaging all relevant parts of the United Nations development system, regardless of where these capacities are based [19]. This inclusive approach has led to more effective responses and increased ability to access United Nations expertise in host countries, with a rise in the percentage of host Governments perceiving that resident coordinators had provided increased access to expertise [19].

Overall, through tailored cooperation frameworks, strengthened partnerships, and improved engagement of United Nations entities, the United Nations offer has been better tailored to meet the specific needs and priorities of small island developing States and least developed countries, contributing to more effective and sustainable development outcomes in these country settings.

联合国的援助方案已经针对不同国家环境进行了更好的定制，例如小岛屿发展中国家和最不发达国家，具体体现在以下几个方面：

1. 对于许多小岛屿发展中国家，已经建立了新的多国可持续发展合作框架，例如针对讲英语和荷兰语的加勒比地区和小岛屿发展中国家以及太平洋地区，使整个系统能够全面参与，以解决区域脆弱性和需求[20]。此外，在佛得角，通过多个联合国实体参与合作框架的设计，为小岛屿发展中国家开发了一个强大的支持系统，这些框架涉及贸易、电子商务、创新融资和数字战略[20]。

2. 对最不发达国家的定制支持也得到了改善，像国际贸易中心（ITC）、联合国环境规划署（UNEP）和世界气象组织（WMO）这样的实体首次为像赞比亚这样的国家提供项目交付方面的专业知识[20]。这种定制支持方法旨在填补通过合作框架设计过程中发现的能力差距，最终增强对这些国家的支持和援助的交付。

3. 驻地协调员在提高联合国援助方案的质量方面发挥了关键作用，他们参与了联合国发展系统所有相关部分的工作，无论这些能力位于何处[19]。这种包容性方法导致了更有效的响应，并增加了在东道国获取联合国专业知识的能力，东道国政府感知到驻地协调员提供了更多专业知识的百分比有所增加[19]。

总体而言，通过定制的合作框架、加强伙伴关系以及改善联合国实体的参与，联合国的援助方案已经更好地定制，以满足小岛屿发展中国家和最不发达国家的具体需求和优先事项，为这些国家环境带来了更有效和可持续的发展成果。

**How do resident coordinators champion gender equality and women's rights within the United Nations framework, as highlighted in the article?**

Resident coordinators play a crucial role in championing gender equality and women's rights within the United Nations framework by actively promoting these principles in various ways:

1. **Integration into Cooperation Frameworks:** Resident coordinators ensure that gender equality results are featured in over 70 cooperation frameworks and are mainstreamed across other priorities [25].

2. **Financial Allocation:** A significant portion (44%) of country team joint programme budgets are directed towards advancing gender equality and women's empowerment [25].

3. **Marker Utilization:** Resident coordinators use a gender equality marker in joint workplans in 69% of country teams, indicating a deliberate focus on advancing gender equality [25].

4. **Reporting and Evaluation:** A substantial number of country teams (76) report on the System-wide Action Plan gender equality scorecard, showcasing transparency and accountability in promoting gender equality [25].

5. **Leadership and Support:** Resident coordinators actively support the roll-out of new standard operating procedures to strengthen gender theme groups in country teams in partnership with UN-Women, ensuring systematic support for the Spotlight Initiative at the country level [25].

6. **Collaborative Efforts:** By collaborating with various UN agencies like ILO, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, and UNICEF, resident coordinators have been instrumental in reaching millions of beneficiaries, establishing national prevention mechanisms, bringing perpetrators to justice, and winning awards for their efforts [25].

Overall, resident coordinators demonstrate leadership, advocacy, and strategic planning to advance gender equality and women's rights within the UN framework, fostering a more inclusive and equitable world.

驻地协调员在联合国框架内倡导性别平等和妇女权利方面发挥着至关重要的作用，他们通过各种方式积极推动这些原则：

1. **融入合作框架：**驻地协调员确保超过70个合作框架中突出性别平等的成果，并将性别平等纳入其他优先事项的主流[25]。

2. **资金分配：**国家团队联合方案预算中有相当大的一部分（44%）被用于推进性别平等和妇女赋权[25]。

3. **标记使用：**在69%的国家团队中，驻地协调员在联合工作计划中使用性别平等标记，表明他们有意识地专注于推进性别平等[25]。

4. **报告和评估：**相当多的国家团队（76个）在全系统性别平等行动计划记分卡上进行报告，展示了在促进性别平等方面的透明度和问责制[25]。

5. **领导和支持：**驻地协调员积极支持推出新的标准操作程序，以加强国家团队中的性别主题小组，并与联合国妇女署合作，确保在国家层面系统性地支持Spotlight倡议[25]。

6. **合作努力：**通过与国际劳工组织（ILO）、联合国开发计划署（UNDP）、联合国教科文组织（UNESCO）、联合国人口基金（UNFPA）和联合国儿童基金会（UNICEF）等不同的联合国机构合作，驻地协调员在触及数百万受益者、建立国家预防机制、将犯罪者绳之以法以及因其努力获得奖项方面发挥了重要作用[25]。

总体而言，驻地协调员展现了领导力、倡导力和战略规划，以在联合国框架内推进性别平等和妇女权利，促进一个更具包容性和公平性的世界。

## RC System Part

**What is the Resident Coordinator system and why is it important for sustainable development?**

The Resident Coordinator system is a key component of the United Nations development system, consisting of Resident Coordinators and their offices at the country level, as well as the Development Coordination Office. The main purpose of the Resident Coordinator system is to ensure that the United Nations development system works together effectively, efficiently, and transparently to support national efforts in advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals [42].

The Resident Coordinator system is important for sustainable development because it serves as a means to an end, providing independent, impartial, and empowered coordination and leadership in order to drive collective action towards achieving sustainable results [42]. The system plays a crucial role in leading United Nations country teams, forging partnerships, and mobilizing funding for integrated support to advance national plans and priorities [3]. Additionally, the Resident Coordinator system is essential for accelerating action, enabling catalytic transitions, and realigning financing for development, all of which are necessary for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals [37a].

Overall, the Resident Coordinator system is vital for maximizing the gains made in investing in a reinvigorated coordination system for development. Its ability to bring together the expertise of all United Nations entities and partners, as well as to leverage financing for the Goals at scale, is crucial for driving sustainable development and achieving the goals set out in the 2030 Agenda [37b].

驻地协调员制度是什么，它为什么对可持续发展至关重要？

驻地协调员制度是联合国发展系统的关键组成部分，包括在国家层面的驻地协调员及其办公室，以及发展协调办公室。驻地协调员制度的主要目的是确保联合国发展系统有效、高效、透明地协同工作，以支持国家努力推进2030年可持续发展议程和实现可持续发展目标[42]。

驻地协调员制度对可持续发展至关重要，因为它是一种手段，提供独立、公正、授权的协调和领导，以推动集体行动，实现可持续成果[42]。该制度在领导联合国国家团队、建立伙伴关系和动员资金以综合支持推进国家计划和优先事项方面发挥着关键作用[3]。此外，驻地协调员制度对于加快行动、促进催化转型和重新调整发展融资至关重要，所有这些都是实现可持续发展目标所必需的[37a]。

总体而言，驻地协调员制度对于最大化投资于振兴的发展协调系统所取得的成果至关重要。它能够汇集所有联合国实体和合作伙伴的专业知识，并利用大规模的融资为实现目标，这对于推动可持续发展和实现2030年议程中设定的目标至关重要[37b]。
